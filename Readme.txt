
Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Device to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis

Project Description
This project is focused on the development of an Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) device designed to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a condition where blood clots form in the deep veins, typically in the legs, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism. The IPC device helps mitigate this risk by promoting blood circulation through periodic compression of the limbs.

Features
Intermittent Compression: The device applies cyclic pressure to the limbs to stimulate blood flow, reducing the risk of clot formation.
Adjustable Pressure Settings: Users can customize the pressure levels to suit individual needs and comfort.
Programmable Compression Cycles: The device offers various compression cycles to optimize therapy effectiveness.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface allows easy control and monitoring of the device.
Portability: Designed for ease of use at home or in clinical settings, the device is lightweight and portable.
Safety Features: Includes pressure sensors and automatic shut-off mechanisms to ensure user safety.
Components
Microcontroller: Manages the timing and control of the compression cycles.
Air Pump: Generates the necessary pressure for limb compression.
Pressure Sensors: Monitor and regulate the applied pressure to ensure it stays within safe limits.
Control Interface: Provides user interaction capabilities for setting and monitoring compression parameters.
Compression Sleeves: Worn on the limbs, these are the main components that inflate and deflate to apply pressure.
How It Works
Setup: The user wraps the compression sleeves around the target limb(s) and secures them.
Configuration: Through the control interface, the user sets the desired pressure level and compression cycle.
Operation: The microcontroller activates the air pump according to the set parameters, inflating the sleeves to apply pressure. After a predetermined period, the sleeves deflate, allowing blood to flow freely again.
Cycle Repeats: The device continues to operate in cycles, ensuring continuous promotion of blood circulation.
Applications
Post-Surgical Recovery: Helps in preventing DVT in patients recovering from surgery.
Long-Term Bed Rest: Beneficial for individuals who are bedridden or have limited mobility.
Travel: Useful for preventing DVT during long periods of immobility, such as long flights or car journeys.
Athletic Recovery: Assists in recovery by improving blood flow and reducing muscle soreness after intense physical activity.
